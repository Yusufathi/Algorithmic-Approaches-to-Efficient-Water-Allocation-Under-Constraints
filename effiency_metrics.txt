# Utilization Efficiency: Maximize the total allocated water relative to the available supply.
# Utilization_Efficiency = Total_Allocated_Water / Total_Water_Supply

# Loss Efficiency: Minimize the water lost in pipelines during distribution.
# Loss_Efficiency = 1 - (Total_Water_Losses / Total_Water_Supply)
# Total_Water_Losses = sum(Allocated_Water_i * Pipeline_Loss_i for i in Regions)

# Fairness Index: Ensure equitable allocation of water among regions relative to their demands.
# Fairness_Index = (1 / n) * sum(Allocated_Water_i / Demand_i for i in Regions)

# Weighted Multi-Objective Optimization
# Overall_Efficiency = (w1 * Utilization_Efficiency) + (w2 * Loss_Efficiency) + (w3 * Fairness_Index)
